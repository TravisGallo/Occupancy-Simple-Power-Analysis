# Occupancy-Simple-Power-Analysis
A simple power analysis for occupancy analysis

This script allows you to perform a simple power analysis for Occupancy analysis. The analysis simulates data and tests whether you can detect a given difference in occupancy between two or more treatments given the number of sites, repeated visits, and a given detection probability.

The current script is set up to test between two treatment types, but can be easily manupilated to test between multiple treatments.
